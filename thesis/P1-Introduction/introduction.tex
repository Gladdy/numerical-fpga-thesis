The most famous equation in the world: $E^2 = (m_0c^2)^2 + (pc)^2$, which is 
known as the \textbf{energy-mass-momentum} relation as an in-line equation.

A {\em \LaTeX{} class file}\index{\LaTeX{} class file@LaTeX class file} is a file, which holds style information for a particular \LaTeX{}.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry (see 
Section~\ref{section1.3}). Lorem Ipsum~\citep{Aup91} has been the industry's 
standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley 
of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only 
five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of 
Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop 
publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem 
Ipsum~\citep{AAB95,Con90,LM65}.
